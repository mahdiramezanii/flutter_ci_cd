## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions)

This repo contains ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows for:

- `android-apk.yml`: Builds & uploads per-ABI APKs to release
- `android-aab.yml`: Builds & uploads AAB to release
- `ios-build.yml`: Builds iOS release (manual export)

Each workflow uses:
- `--obfuscate` for Dart code protection
- `--split-debug-info` for crash diagnostics

See `.github/workflows/` directory.
